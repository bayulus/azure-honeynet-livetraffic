<p> This project covers the end-to-end setup of Azure Sentinel, a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution. It includes connecting it to a live virtual machine acting as a honeypot to observe and analyze RDP brute force attacks worldwide. The custom PowerShell script enhances the analysis by looking up attackers' geolocation information and visualizing it on the Azure Sentinel Map.</p>
